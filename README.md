## ✨ A screensaver with a sense of wonder

OmniScreenSaver is a lightweight **web page—not a native app**—that transforms a display into a looping world of color, light, and motion. Choose a name, choose a scene, and watch that name become part of the animation rather than sit on top of it.

The interface is available in **English and বাংলা (Bengali)**, with a customizable name and 19 visual modes designed to run fullscreen in a modern browser.

### The experience

- **Your name belongs in the scene.** It can gather from stardust, glow in falling rain, ripple across sand, or rise from campfire embers.
- **Ambient sound in every mode.** Each scene has a gentle soundscape, with a master **sound on/off** switch and **volume control**. The audio is soft and atmospheric.
- **Made to loop.** Animations are designed to continue until you choose to leave.
- **Simple exit behavior.** Mouse movement reveals the close control without stopping the animation; a close-button click, touch, or key press exits the screensaver.
- **English + বাংলা.** The interface supports both languages, including Bengali names and text.

## 🎨 The 19 worlds

The gallery contains **19 visual modes**. Each mode has its own ambient sound profile and a visual treatment that weaves your name into the scene.

| World | What to expect |
|---|---|
| ✨ **Starfield Warp** | Stars gather into your name before you fly through the field. |
| 💫 **Mystify** | Neon ribbons fold around the outline of your name, then drift free. |
| 🪄 **3D Pipes** | Colorful pipes grow through a three-dimensional space. |
| 🧭 **3D Maze** | Wander through a self-walking maze with your name on its walls. |
| 🏓 **Bouncing Name** | Your name becomes the bouncing, color-shifting centerpiece. |
| 🔷 **3D Spinning Name** | Shimmering letters turn slowly in space. |
| 🌧️ **Matrix Rain** | Falling characters gather into a glowing name, then wash away. |
| 💻 **Hacker Terminal** | A friendly terminal types a welcome and reveals your name in glowing text. |
| 🧬 **Game of Life** | Living cells begin in the shape of your name and evolve. |
| 🎆 **Fireworks** | Gentle bursts of light sketch your name across the night. |
| 🌌 **Aurora** | A flowing aurora writes your name in the sky. |
| 🫧 **Lava Lamp** | Slow-moving blobs merge into letterforms and melt apart. |
| 🌬️ **Flow Field** | Glowing threads weave around the shape of your name. |
| 🌠 **Particle Constellation** | Dots connect to form your name, then scatter like stars. |
| 🌇 **Synthwave** | Chrome lettering floats above a neon sunset and grid. |
| 🕰️ **Flip Clock** | A calm clock scene with a personal greeting. |
| 🔥 **Campfire Night** | Firelight, pine silhouettes, and sparks that gather into your name. |
| 🌊 **Beach Bonfire** | A moonlit shore where waves gently wash your name from the sand. |
| 🏕️ **Pixel Campfire** | A cozy, retro pixel-art campsite with ember-lit lettering. |

*Shuffle mode rotates through the worlds automatically at your chosen interval.*

## 🔊 Sound, softly done

Sound is part of the atmosphere—not a soundtrack competing for attention. Every world has a distinct, gentle ambient layer with quiet cues tied to what is on screen: a soft chime when a name bounces, a wave as the tide rolls in, or a delicate tick in the clock scene.

Use the master sound toggle and volume slider on the start page or in the mouse-revealed screensaver controls. Audio is synthesized in-browser with the Web Audio API, so there are no audio downloads. Browsers require a user gesture to start sound; an idle auto-start therefore begins silently until you enable audio.

## 🧰 Technology

The implementation is browser-native and static-site friendly:

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Page and interface | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES modules |
| Visuals | Canvas 2D and WebGL |
| Ambient audio | Web Audio API |
| Fullscreen | Browser Fullscreen API, where supported |
| Keep-awake behavior | Screen Wake Lock API, where supported |
| Language and text | Browser internationalization APIs, with English and Bengali support |
| Deployment target | GitHub Pages (static root) |

There is no framework or build step, and the page has no external runtime dependencies. Bengali fonts are self-hosted under the SIL Open Font License; all scene audio is generated locally in the browser.

## 🚀 Try it

### Run locally

Serve the repository root over HTTP (ES modules do not run from `file://`):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000> in a modern browser. No build or package installation is needed. To run the built-in checks with Node.js:

```bash
npm run check
```

### Published version

The Play button at the top points to the intended GitHub Pages address:

**https://muya2026.github.io/OmniScreenSaver/**

It will become playable there once Pages is enabled and the site is published. Fullscreen and audio depend on browser support and user permissions; on devices that restrict fullscreen, the page fills the available screen area instead.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] Build the bilingual start page, name settings, and screensaver engine
- [x] Add fullscreen entry/exit behavior, Wake Lock support, and ambient sound controls
- [x] Implement all 19 visual modes, including three campfire scenes
- [x] Add shuffle, live hover previews, share links, and Bengali clock/calendar support
- [ ] Review the live preview on desktop and mobile, then polish from feedback
- [ ] Publish the static site on GitHub Pages
